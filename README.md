# MA4K8
MA4K8 Project Code

This repository contains all necessary code for Benjamin McIntyre's MA4K8 Project for the University of Warwick, UK.

Files named graphWHK.py, graphOWNMODEL.py and graphFJ.py initialise the network on which to run the opinion dynamics model.

Files AdaptedFJ.py, AdaptedWHK.py and OwnModel.py contain the opinion dynamics models. The AdaptedWHK.py has referenced the author of the original code, which I have adapted. The other files are my own.

The file parameter.py contains all the necessary parameters for the networks.

Files runMODELS.py, test.py and resultsplotter.py are used for running the models and outputting data.
